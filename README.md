  Kicking off #100DaysOfGatsby
</h1>

 For the first two days of #100DaysOfGatsby I went through parts 0-3 of the [Gatsby tutorials](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).
 Unlike suggested in the tutorials though I did not create separate projects for all of them and just kept on adding stuff to the one created in part zero.
